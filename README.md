This is the home for my Python project focused on the sounds characteristics of electronic music. I got the underlying data from a [public Kaggle dataset]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcfurland/10-m-beatport-tracks-spotify-audio-features))

[If you visit this Streamlit app I built]([url](https://uwsthoughts.streamlit.app/)), you can see the output of my initial discovery work. This shows some initial ideas I had about the data and includes commentary on whether my ideas ended up being good or not. The goal is for a bit of radical transparency around how I think through a new data project and what does and doesn't matter to me. As I learn more Python and start getting into machine learning and neural network components, my approach will evolve.

By late fall, my goal is to start a 3-4 month training of [Meta's Llama 3 model]([url](https://llama.meta.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/meta-llama-3/)) (most likely using a [finetuning method]([url](https://llama.meta.com/docs/how-to-guides/fine-tuning)) for practical compute cost reasons). I'm interested in the characteristics of house and techno music and, how trends have and will changed, and what future outputs may look like. I'm aiming for a 30-50GB dataset to ensure I don't have a model overfitting issue. 

[Magenta]([url](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/)), an open source tool for the application of machine learning to music, [has some cool datasets I might use]([url](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets)).
